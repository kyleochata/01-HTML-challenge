# 01-HTML-challenge

## About this challenge

This is the first challenge for the UCI full-stack bootcamp exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and GitHub. The challenge was to simulate an on-the-job ticket. The ticket was for us to engage in refactoring the  existing code to meet the criteria of: adding semantic elements to HTML, ensuring elements followed a logical structure of styling and positioning, adding accessibility to the files, having the headings in sequential order, and updating the title to be concise and descriptive. 



The first image is what the start code looked in the browser:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

The updated webpage can be found [here](https://kyleochata.github.io/01-HTML-challenge/) and looks like the following in the browser:

During this challenge, I learnt how to take pre-existing code and refactor it to have be more condensed and cleaner than the existing code without changing the appearance of the webpage. I was able to practice the basic vernacular of HTML5 and modern CSS to achieve the above goal.
