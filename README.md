# 01-HTML-challenge

## About this challenge

This is the first challenge for the UCI full-stack bootcamp exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and GitHub. The challenge was to simulate an on-the-job ticket. The ticket was for us to engage in refactoring the  existing code to meet the criteria of: adding semantic elements to HTML, ensuring elements followed a logical structure of styling and positioning, adding accessibility to the files, having the headings in sequential order, and updating the title to be concise and descriptive. 

During this challenge, I learnt how to take pre-existing code and refactor it to have be more condensed and cleaner than the existing code. I was able to practice the basic vernacular of HTML5 and modern CSS to achieve the above goal.
